Flow SFTP can watch a directory for new files and upload them to a remote SFTP host in near real time.

(*Written in Go*)

## ü™∂ Features
- Copy new files almost in real time.
- Configurable via a yaml config file.
- Clear backlog files.
- Backup files to a separate directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

```yaml
flow:
  source: "/path/to/directory/" # Path to the directory you want to watch for
  backupDir: "/path/to/directory/" # Path to your backup directory 
  enableBackups: false # Enable/Disable backups
